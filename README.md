## About This Project

This project implements a **News Summarization System** as a real-world example of the Spring AI Parallelization Workflow. It showcases how to:

*   Set up a Spring Boot application with Spring AI.
*   Configure Spring AI to use Google Gemini (or other LLMs).
*   Implement the `ParallelizationWorkflow` to process multiple news articles concurrently.
*   Send multiple independent summarization requests to an LLM in parallel.
*   Aggregate the results.
*   Use Logbook to observe and verify parallel HTTP calls to the LLM.
